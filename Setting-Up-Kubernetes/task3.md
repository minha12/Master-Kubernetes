# Example: Deploying an HTTP Echo Server

We will use the k8s.gcr.io/echoserver Docker image, which is a simple HTTP server that responds with the headers it received. This is an excellent way for beginners to understand how to interact with applications running within a Kubernetes cluster.

Step 1: Create a Deployment
Deploy the echo server using the following kubectl command:

`kubectl create deployment echo-server --image=k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.10`

This command creates a deployment named echo-server using the echoserver image.

Step 2: Expose the Deployment as a Service
To access the echo server from outside the Kubernetes cluster, expose it as a service:

`kubectl expose deployment echo-server --type=NodePort --port=8080`

This command creates a service that exposes the echo server on a port that will be dynamically assigned by Minikube.

Step 3: Find the Service URL
Minikube provides an easy command to find the URL of the exposed service:

`minikube service echo-server --url`

This command will output a URL that you can use to access the echo server from your web browser or using a tool like curl.

Step 4: Access the Service
Open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by the previous command, or use curl to access the service:

`curl $(minikube service echo-server --url)`

This will send a request to your echo server, and you should see a response that displays the headers sent by your HTTP client (in this case, curl).

Step 5: Monitor the Deployment
You can check the status of your deployment using:

`kubectl get deployment echo-server`

And for the service:

`kubectl get service echo-server`

You can also see the details and events related to the deployment:

`kubectl describe deployment echo-server`

And for the service:

`kubectl describe service echo-server`

Step 6: Update the Deployment (Optional)
If you need to update the image or change the number of replicas, you can do so using the kubectl set or kubectl scale commands. Hereâ€™s how to scale the deployment to run 3 instances of the echo server:

`kubectl scale deployment echo-server --replicas=3`

After a few moments, you can check the status and see that you now have three replicas:

`kubectl get pods`

Step 7: Clean Up
Once you are done experimenting, you can delete the deployment and service to clean up:

`kubectl delete service echo-server`
`kubectl delete deployment echo-server`

This ensures no resources are left running that could incur costs or utilize system resources.
